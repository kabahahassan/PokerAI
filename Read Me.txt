In our project we used "numpy" library. 
to download the library: 

- Pycharm: 
-> file -> setting -> project -> project interpreter -> " + " (top right)
-> search : " numpy " -> install package. 

- Anaconda: 
-> anaconda prompt : " conda install -c anaconda numpy " 

Also i used a " treys " library for poker, the library included
in the submission file. 

To run: 
Create new project with the 2 library with " training.py " file.
-> run " training.py " 

exe file:
When you run the exe file, it will take 1 min to run
because the size of the file so big i have attached a link to the drive.
